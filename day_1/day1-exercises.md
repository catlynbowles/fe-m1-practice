1. HTMl describes the structure of pages
2. HTML code is made up of characters that live inside brackets, called HTML elements. The elements
are made up of two tags, an opening and closing tag. Each element tells the browser something about
the information that sits between opening and closing tags.
3. Attributes provide additional info about the elements' content. They're located in the opening tag
and made up of two parts: a name and a value. The name and value are seperated by an = sign.
4. <body> is shown in the main browser window. <head> is often before the <body>, contains information
about the page. <title> is usually inside the <head> element.

8. semantic markup provides extra information, such as emphasis placed in a sentence, that something you
have written is a quotation, meaning of acronyms, etc.
